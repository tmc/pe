# In a real implementation, this would:
# 1. Extract prompts, tests, and variables from the config
# 2. For each prompt and test case, execute against CGPT
# 3. Check the responses against the assertions
# 4. Compile the results and output in the standard format

# For example (pseudo-code):
#   Extract prompts, tests, vars, assertions from config
#   For each prompt:
#     For each test case:
#       Replace variables in prompt
#       Send to CGPT
#       Process response
#       Validate against assertions
#       Record results

# For now, we return a simulated result
